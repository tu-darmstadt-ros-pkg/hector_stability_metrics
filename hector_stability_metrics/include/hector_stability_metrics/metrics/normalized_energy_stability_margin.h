   * @brief NormalizedEnergyStabilityMargin This class computes the Normalized Energy Stability Margin by Hirose et al. as defined in "An improved energy stability margin for
   * walking machines subject to dynamic effects" (Garcia, De Santos, 2005). Additionally to the original formulation, a sign function can be given in order for  the stability
   * value to be negative for unstable edges of the support polygon. This is helpful if used to analyze or optimize the stability. The original unsigned version is used in the
   * default case by setting sign_function to a function allways returning 1.
   * @param minimum_function The minimum function that should be used for determining the overall stability.
   * @param sign_function If set to ConstantOne the original unsigened version as defined by Garcia and De Santos is used. If set to the standard sign function or a function
   * approximating it the stability values for unstable edges will be negative. As the sign function is not contiously differentiable it is recommended to use an approximation when
   * this metric is used for gradient based optimization.
