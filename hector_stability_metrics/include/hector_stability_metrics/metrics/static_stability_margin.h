/** @brief This method computes the Static Stability Margin defined in "On the Stability Properties of Quadruped Creeping Gaits" (McGhee, Frank, 1968).
 * 
 * @tparam Scalar The scalar type used for computations.
 * @tparam DataStruct A data struct with additional information required by the stability measure.
 * 
 * @param support_polygon A support polygon where it is assumed that the points are ordered clockwise when viewed from
 * above.
 * @param data In this case a method named @b centerOfMass returning a Vector3<Scalar> representing the center of mass is required.
 *   Optionally, you can also provide a method normalizationFactor returning a Scalar normalization factor that is applied to all edges.
 * @param edge_stabilities Output vector for the stability values for all edges of the support polygon
